# capsalert
## Project Overview
For our final group project we created a medication notification app, this android app allows users to create an account and input their medical history, allergies, and current medication.
Capsalert allows the user to have multiple reminders for specific medications, which will provide a push notification to the phone with a discreet message reminding them to take their schedualed medications.

## How to use this app

When you first access the app you will be greeted with a sign in/sign up page, if you already have an account log in as normal; if not, create a new account. After this you may go into all the different pages and input the information you choose.
You can add into your medical history page previous diagnosises and medical appoinments.  
Add any important allergies into the allergy page.  
Add medications into the medication page, when adding this information add the name, start and end date, dosage and regularity (you can edit and delete these medications at any time).  
In an effort to help users feel less alone or scared we have created a more info tag containing some information about the medication we have also linked the nhs page for each medication you add in the more info tag, some of which contain a forum where people can share similar experiences with the medication.  
We have also implemented a text to speach function in this more info tag to allow uses with sight impairments to still have full access to our app.  
You can view these notifications in the due medications page, where there is a colour coded and chronological list of your notifications, incluing missed medications, imminent notifications and ones scheduled for later in the day. 
Lastly you can sign in and out of your account with ease, using the sign out button.
